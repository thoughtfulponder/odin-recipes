      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>I first brought these to a gathering on a whim, and they ended up stealing the show. Ever since, friends and
        <br>
        family have been requesting them at every get-together, swearing there’s something special about their <br>
        flavor that keeps them coming back. I’m happy to share them with you—here’s hoping they become just as <br>
        much of a favorite in your home as they are in mine.</p>

      <h3>ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>12 eggs</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons mayonnaise</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon hot pepper sauce, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt and black pepper</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground paprika, for dusting (divided)</li>
        <li>1 (6 ounce) can black olives, drained and cut in half horizontally</li>
      </ul>
      <hr />
      <h3>steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Place eggs in a saucepan with a lid, pour in water to cover, <br>
          bring to a boil, and remove from the heat. Cover and let stand for 10 to 12 minutes. <br>
          Remove eggs from hot water and let cool. Peel the eggs.</li>
        <li>Cut each egg in half lengthwise, remove the yolks, and place the yolks in a bowl with the mustard, <br>
          mayonnaise, Worcestershire sauce, hot pepper sauce, and salt and pepper. Mash the yolks, <br>
          and stir the mixture until smooth and thoroughly combined.</li>
        <li>Fill each egg half with the deviled yolk mixture, using a spoon, piping bag, <br>
          or a sturdy plastic bag with a corner cut off. Dust each egg with a pinch of paprika, <br>
          and place an olive half, round side up, in the center of each. Refrigerate until chilled, 20 to 30 minutes,
          and serve cold.</li>
      </ol>
