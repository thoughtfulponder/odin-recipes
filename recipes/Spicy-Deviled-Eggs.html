  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>I made these for a holiday party, and have been asked to make them over and over again ever since. I've been told they have a good unique flavor to them. Hope you enjoy them as much as my friends and family!</p>
  <h3>ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>12 eggs</li>
    <li>1 ½ tablespoons Dijon mustard</li>
    <li>1 ½ tablespoons mayonnaise</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon hot pepper sauce, or to taste</li>
    <li>1 pinch salt and black pepper</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon ground paprika, for dusting (divided)</li>
    <li>1 (6 ounce) can black olives, drained and cut in half horizontally</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Place eggs in a saucepan with a lid, pour in water to cover, bring to a boil, and remove from the heat. Cover and let stand for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove eggs from hot water and let cool. Peel the eggs.</li>
    <li>Cut each egg in half lengthwise, remove the yolks, and place the yolks in a bowl with the mustard, mayonnaise, Worcestershire sauce, hot pepper sauce, and salt and pepper. Mash the yolks, and stir the mixture until smooth and thoroughly combined.</li>
    <li>Fill each egg half with the deviled yolk mixture, using a spoon, piping bag, or a sturdy plastic bag with a corner cut off. Dust each egg with a pinch of paprika, and place an olive half, round side up, in the center of each. Refrigerate until chilled, 20 to 30 minutes, and serve cold.</li>
