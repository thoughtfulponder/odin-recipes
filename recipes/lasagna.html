    <h2>Best Lasagna</h2>
    <p>What makes this classic lasagna recipe so spectacular? Homemade meat sauce and plenty of cheese. <br>
        Best of all, it's easy to make lasagna ahead of time so dinner can be ready in a flash.</p>
    <p>Lasagna was one of the first dishes I learned to make in college. The early attempts were based on an easy <br>
        lasagna recipe that kept dishes to a minimum but still provided plenty of leftovers. When I would cook it, the <br>
        irresistible aroma of melting cheese and robust <strong>pasta sauce</strong> would waft down the hall. It earned <br>
        me a reputation as the cook on my floor. Before long, I started doubling the lasagna ingredients to make it in a <br>
        huge disposable panâ€”perfect for feeding a crowd or for holiday occasions.</p>
