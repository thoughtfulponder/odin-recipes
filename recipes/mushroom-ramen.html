  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>In this mushroom ramen, dried shiitake mushrooms season instant ramen broth while they hydrate, and you can toss that seasoning packet. Add a few more ingredients to give body to the broth, and then top with whatever you like best—kimchi, chopped green onions, chili crisp, soft or hard boiled eggs—for even more flavor. Quail eggs are a great size for this, but chicken eggs work, too.</p>

    <li>8 cups water</li>
    <li>2 cups dried shiitake mushrooms</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon white miso paste</li>

    <li>1/2 teaspoon ginger paste</li>
    <li>2 (3.5-ounce) packages instant ramen noodles, seasoning packets discarded</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>steps</h3>
