  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>In this comforting mushroom ramen, dried shiitake mushrooms slowly rehydrate as they infuse the broth <br>
     with deep, earthy flavor—no need for the instant noodle seasoning packet. A few extra pantry staples enrich <br>
     the base, giving it a satisfying depth and body. From there, it’s all about the toppings: tangy kimchi, fresh <br>
     chopped green onions, a drizzle of chili crisp, or your choice of eggs for added richness. Quail eggs make a <br>
     charming bite-sized garnish, but a perfectly cooked chicken egg is just as delicious.</p>
